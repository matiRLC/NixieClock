# NixieClock
Nixie Tube Clock based project based on existing code and boards by Ogilumen and RobotPirate

The current project uses an Arduino Uno and the Arduinix Shield from RobotPirate. The code is an extension of the sample code
provided by the latter. The PCB for 6 nixie tubes was designed based on the .pdf schematic available in [Arduinix](http://www.arduinix.com).

Next update will include a RTC and, possibly, bluetooth slave circuit to set the time using and android app.
